# Modern DevOps Practices for Web Applications

DevOps has become essential for modern web development. This guide covers the fundamental practices and tools that enable teams to deliver software faster, more reliably, and with higher quality.

## Containerization with Docker

### Why Docker?

Docker provides a consistent environment across development, testing, and production:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Multi-stage Builds

Optimize your Docker images with multi-stage builds:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS production
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Orchestration with Kubernetes

### Basic Deployment

Deploy your application to Kubernetes:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: web-app
        image: your-registry/web-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
```

### Service Configuration

Expose your application with a Kubernetes service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: web-app
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 3000
  type: LoadBalancer
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Example

Automate your deployment process:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Build Docker image
      run: docker build -t web-app:${{ github.sha }} .
    
    - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
      run: |
        kubectl set image deployment/web-app web-app=web-app:${{ github.sha }}
        kubectl rollout status deployment/web-app
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Health Checks

Implement proper health checks:

```javascript
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    uptime: process.uptime()
  });
});
```

### Logging

Structured logging for better observability:

```javascript
const winston = require('winston');

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: winston.format.combine(
    winston.format.timestamp(),
    winston.format.json()
  ),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console(),
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'app.log' })
  ]
});
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Image Scanning**: Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities
2. **Secrets Management**: Use Kubernetes secrets or external secret managers
3. **Network Policies**: Implement network segmentation
4. **RBAC**: Configure proper role-based access control

## Conclusion

Modern DevOps practices enable teams to deliver software with confidence. By implementing containerization, orchestration, and automated deployment pipelines, you can achieve faster delivery cycles while maintaining high quality and reliability.
