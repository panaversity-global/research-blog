# Getting Started with Next.js 15

Next.js 15 brings exciting new features and improvements that make building modern web applications even more powerful and efficient. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the key features and how to get started with your first Next.js 15 project.

## What's New in Next.js 15

### Enhanced Performance
- **Improved build times**: Faster compilation and bundling
- **Better caching**: More intelligent caching strategies
- **Optimized rendering**: Enhanced server-side and client-side rendering

### Developer Experience
- **Better TypeScript support**: Improved type checking and IntelliSense
- **Enhanced debugging**: Better error messages and debugging tools
- **Streamlined configuration**: Simplified setup and configuration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before diving into Next.js 15, make sure you have:
- Node.js 18.17 or later
- npm, yarn, or pnpm package manager
- Basic knowledge of React and JavaScript

### Installation

Create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

### Project Structure

A typical Next.js 15 project structure looks like this:

```
my-app/
├── app/                 # App Router directory
│   ├── layout.tsx      # Root layout
│   ├── page.tsx        # Home page
│   └── globals.css     # Global styles
├── public/             # Static assets
├── components/         # Reusable components
└── package.json        # Dependencies
```

## Key Features

### App Router
The App Router is the recommended way to structure your Next.js applications:

```tsx
// app/page.tsx
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to Next.js 15!</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Server Components
Server Components run on the server and can directly access backend resources:

```tsx
// app/posts/page.tsx
async function getPosts() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts')
  return res.json()
}

export default async function PostsPage() {
  const posts = await getPosts()
  
  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <article key={post.id}>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          <p>{post.content}</p>
        </article>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization
1. **Use Server Components** when possible
2. **Implement proper caching** strategies
3. **Optimize images** with the Next.js Image component
4. **Code splitting** for better loading performance

### SEO and Metadata
```tsx
import { Metadata } from 'next'

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'My Next.js App',
  description: 'A modern web application built with Next.js 15',
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 continues to push the boundaries of what's possible with React-based web applications. With its enhanced performance, improved developer experience, and powerful features, it's an excellent choice for building modern web applications.
