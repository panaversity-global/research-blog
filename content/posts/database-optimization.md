# Database Optimization: Performance and Scalability

Database performance is critical for application success. This comprehensive guide covers essential optimization techniques for modern database systems.

## Query Optimization

### 1. Indexing Strategies
- Primary and secondary indexes
- Composite indexes
- Partial indexes
- Covering indexes

### 2. Query Analysis
- EXPLAIN plans
- Query profiling
- Performance monitoring

### 3. Query Rewriting
- Subquery optimization
- JOIN optimization
- Window functions

## Database Design

### Normalization
- First, second, third normal forms
- Denormalization strategies
- Data integrity

### Partitioning
- Horizontal partitioning
- Vertical partitioning
- Partition pruning

## Performance Tuning

### Configuration
- Memory settings
- Connection pooling
- Cache configuration

### Monitoring
- Performance metrics
- Slow query logs
- Resource utilization

## Example Optimizations

### Index Creation
```sql
-- Create composite index
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email_status ON users(email, status);

-- Create partial index
CREATE INDEX idx_active_users ON users(id) WHERE status = 'active';
```

### Query Optimization
```sql
-- Before: Slow query
SELECT * FROM orders o
JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.created_at > '2024-01-01';

-- After: Optimized query
SELECT o.*, u.name 
FROM orders o
JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.created_at > '2024-01-01'
AND o.status = 'completed';
```

## Conclusion

Database optimization is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring and adjustment. By implementing these techniques, you can significantly improve your database performance and application scalability.
